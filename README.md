 ðŸ‘‹ **Hi, Iâ€™m Rachel Kittrell!** I'm an avid learner, researcher, and storyteller with a passion for solving problems and helping businesses and individuals reach their highest potential! As a Data Scientist I channel this passion into data-driven insights, tackling challenges head on
 and uncovering hidden knowledge within data. Whether building predictive models from historical data, forecasting future events with time series analysis, or determining sentiment in text, my skills offer a broad range of solutions to address any problem! <br> 
 
 With a 20-year background working closely with small business owners, I have a deep understanding of the factors that drive success or failure. I thrive in collaborative environments, having co-led a team for a mid-sized company and worked with clients and colleagues nationwide.
 My ability to learn quickly, adapt to change, work under pressure, motivate teams, and communicate effectively has consistently led me to leadership and training roles throughout my career. <br> 
 
 As I always say, "I can't help myself if I'm not helping others"- and that includes learning from those around me. If I'm ever the smartest person in the room, well then, it's time to find a new room! I'd love to collaborate and see how we can learn from each other.
